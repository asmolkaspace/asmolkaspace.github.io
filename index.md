To be able to use the `ExESS` package, the entire repository has to be downloaded from LRZ-GitLab. Afterwards, the code can be used in a number of different ways. The entire module can be included directly by specifying the path of the downloaded package in the `include` call.


```julia
include(joinpath(PathToPackage, "src", "ExESS.jl"))
using .ExESS
```
